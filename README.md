# Astar (A*) algorithm
Astar assignment - A routing problem

Authors: Isidre Mas Magre & Martha Domhoefer

The assignment consists in computing an optimal path (according to distance) from Basílica de Santa Maria del Mar (Plaça de Santa Maria) in Barcelona to the Giralda (Calle Mateos Gago) in Sevilla by using AStar algorithm over a graph constructed with data from OpenStreetMaps. The program implemented to solve this problem also accepts other origins and destinations available in the dataset and additionally Dijstra algorithm has also been implemented for comparison purposes.

This docucument will only explain the repository structure and operation of the program. For a detailed explanation of the methods used to develop the program a report has also been compiled as part of this assignment.
