# Astar (A*) algorithm
Astar assignment - A routing problem

Authors: Isidre Mas Magre & Martha Domhoefer

The assignment consists in computing an optimal path (according to distance) from Basílica de Santa Maria del Mar (Plaça de Santa Maria) in Barcelona to the Giralda (Calle Mateos Gago) in Sevilla by using an AStar algorithm. To this end one has to implement the AStar algorithm (compulsory in form of a function — not inside the main code) and compute and write the optimal path.
